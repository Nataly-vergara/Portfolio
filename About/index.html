     <h2><p>Artist Statement</p> </h2>
    <div class="content-state">
        <p>
            My practice is shaped by my pursuit of artistic stimuli through processed based work. I find these processes through material exploration. Through investigation, I discover methods and rules which create challenges to navigate. Within these set limitations there are infinite creative possibilities. This removes expectations of a certain end. My work comes to fruition when the process comes to an end.

        <p>Nataly Vergara is an undergraduate at Ohio State University, from Huntsville, Alabama. Nataly pulls motifs from observation combined with an imaginative hand. Primarily a painter, Nataly describes work with other mediums in term of their relationship to the practice of painting. This sense of materiality is indicative of her constructive process to manifest complete works. </p>
